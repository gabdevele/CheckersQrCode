# Checkers
This project was created for #saycheese, a Hack Club event challenging developers to create applications that fit within a QR code.
I developed a classic checkers game using JavaScript.
In this repo you can find the full version of the game by clicking [here](https://gabdevele.github.io/checkers/)
or try out the qr code version by scanning the qr code below or by just clicking [here](https://gabdevele.github.io/checkers/minified).
